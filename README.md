# Metadata Template Transformation

## Introduction

The programs bundled in this repository intend to solve the problem of automatically retrieving metadata records for a given study submitted to NMDC through the [NMDC Submission Portal](https://data.microbiomedata.org/submission/home), and converting the metadata into Excel spreadsheets that are accepted by [DOE user facilities](https://www.energy.gov/science/office-science-user-facilities).

There are two components to keep in mind when trying to use this application.

1. JSON header configuration file
  * The headers that go into the user facility spreadsheet outputs is controlled by JSON files.
  * The keys at the top level are used to indicate the main headers in the output. These values have mappings in the mapping configuration files described in the next point.
  * You can use numbered keys to add more header information to clarify what a particular column contains.
  * The *header* keyword is reserved in case you want to use some other column names as the main header.
  * The *sub_port_mapping* keyword can be used to specify mappings between columns in the Submission Portal template and columns in the user facility spreadsheet outputs.
  * Follow the examples that have already been specified in [input-files](input-files/). There are two user facility header customizations that have already been created as examples for the NMDC. They are:
    * EMSL header configuration: [emsl_header.json](input-files/emsl_header.json)
    * JGI MG and MT header configuration
      * [jgi_mg_header.json](input-files/jgi_mg_header.json)
      * [jgi_mt_header.json](input-files/jgi_mt_header.json)

2. [etl.py](etl.py)
   The command line application that can facilitate the conversion of metadata from the Submission Portal into user facility formats by consuming the above two files as inputs.

## Software Requirements
1. [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
2. Python 3.9

## Setup

1. Install dependencies with poetry

```
poetry install
```

2. Run `etl.py` with options as follows:

```bash
➜  metadata-template-transformation git:(main) ✗ poetry run python etl.py --help                                          
Usage: etl.py [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -o, --output TEXT         Path to result output XLSX file.  [required]
  -m, --mapper PATH         Path to user facility specific JSON file.
                            [required]
  -h, --header BOOLEAN      [default: False]
  -u, --user-facility TEXT  User facility to send data to.  [required]
  -s, --submission TEXT     Metadata submission id.  [required]
  --help                    Show this message and exit.
```
