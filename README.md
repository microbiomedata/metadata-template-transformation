# Metadata Template Transformation

## Introduction

The programs bundled in this repository intend to solve the problem of automatically retrieving metadata records for a given study submitted to NMDC through the [NMDC Submission Portal](https://data.microbiomedata.org/submission/home), and converting the metadata into Excel spreadsheets that are accepted by [DOE user facilities](https://www.energy.gov/science/office-science-user-facilities).

There are two components to keep in mind when trying to use this application.

1. JSON header configuration file
  * The headers that go into the user facility spreadsheet outputs is controlled by JSON files.
  * The keys at the top level are used to indicate the main headers in the output. These values have mappings in the mapping configuration files described in the next point.
  * You can use numbered keys to add more header information to clarify what a particular column contains.
  * The *header* keyword is reserved in case you want to use some other column names as the main header.
  * The *sub_port_mapping* keyword can be used to specify mappings between columns in the Submission Portal template and columns in the user facility spreadsheet outputs.
  * Follow the examples that have already been specified in [input-files](input-files/). There are two user facility header customizations that have already been created as examples for the NMDC. They are:
    * EMSL header configuration: [emsl_header.json](input-files/emsl_header.json)
    * JGI MG and MT header configuration
      * [jgi_mg_header.json](input-files/jgi_mg_header.json)
      * [jgi_mt_header.json](input-files/jgi_mt_header.json)

2. [etl.py](etl.py)
   The command line application that can facilitate the conversion of metadata from the Submission Portal into user facility formats by consuming the above two files as inputs.

## Software Requirements
1. [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
    - https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer 
3. [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-390/)

## Setup

1.  Clone this repo

```
git clone https://github.com/microbiomedata/metadata-template-transformation.git
```

2. Install dependencies with poetry

```
poetry install
```

3. Cookie access to the submission portal is required and can be provided by editing the .env file. Requires you be an individual with appropriate access to the submission you're transforming.
- 1. When **signed into** the NMDC data portal, submission portal, or api sites, right click & select 'Inspect'
- 2. In the 'Application' menu, select 'Local Storage', specifically, the storage for the NMDC portal
- 3. For the  'Storage Refresh Token' copy the 'Value'
- 4. Edit your .env file and add this value to the file. This should read 
```
DATA_PORTAL_REFRESH_TOKEN={value}
```

4. Run `etl.py` with options as follows:

```bash
➜  metadata-template-transformation git:(main) ✗ poetry run python etl.py --help                                          
Usage: etl.py [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -o, --output TEXT           Path to result output XLSX file.  [required]
  -m, --mapper PATH           Path to user facility specific JSON file.
                              [required]
  -h, --header / --no-header  [default: no-header]
  -u, --user-facility TEXT    User facility to send data to.  [required]
  -s, --submission TEXT       Metadata submission id.  [required]
  --help                      Show this message and exit.
```
- Example- JGI
```
poetry run python etl.py --submission {UUID of the target submission} --user-facility jgi_mg --mapper input-files/jgi_mg_header.json --output file-name_jgi.xlsx
```
- Example- EMSL
```
poetry run python etl.py --submission df1d2ba5-33be-43d0-b4b9-e5d57ace3f70 --user-facility emsl --mapper input-files/emsl_header.json --output file-name_emsl.xlsx 
```
